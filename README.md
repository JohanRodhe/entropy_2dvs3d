# entropy_2dvs3d
 Calculating Shannon index for 2d and 3d graphs. Tools to create heatmaps and violinplots to demonstrate benefit of 3d graphs over 2d. 
 It does this by considering cell populations in the graphs two by two and calculating population overlap with the [Shannon Diversity index] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index).
